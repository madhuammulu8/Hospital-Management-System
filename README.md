# Summary: Hospital Management System Build using Salesforce

The Hospital Management System built using Salesforce is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline and optimize the processes within a healthcare facility. Various features are integrated into the system, which facilitates smooth communication and coordination between doctors, patients, and receptionists. The basic features of the system shall be listed below:

### Tech Stack : 
Apex, Visualforce, Lightning Web Components (LWC), Salesforce APIs, Security and Access Control, Workflow and Process Automation

## Doctor login and Time Slot Management:

Physicians can easily log in to the platform and provide their contact details, credentials, or available time slots(for this week/month) to make an appointment. This information is stored in a centralized database, allowing for efficient scheduling and management of appointments.

## Patient Profile Creation and Appointment Request:

The patient may add his or her personal profile to the system and input vital information, such as health records, contact details, etc. Other mandatory fields. In addition, they will be able to describe their health problems and determine the amount of consultation fee that they are willing to pay. This enables the system to prioritize and coordinate patients with a doctor who fulfills their needs.

## Appointment Scheduling by Receptionists:

Receptionists provide an intermediary between patients and doctors, who have access to both the patient profile(Such as Reason for visit and date of visit....) and a doctor's calendar. Based on the patient's condition, the availability of a healthcare provider, and additional relevant factors, play an essential role in selecting appropriate healthcare providers. The appointment booking process can be effectively managed by the reception staff, ensuring an optimum use of doctors' time slots and reducing waiting times for patients.

In general, the hospital management system that has been built using Salesforce is leveraging the platform's strength to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare operations. By facilitating seamless communication and coordination among doctors, patients, and receptionists, the system ultimately aims to improve patient care and satisfaction while optimizing resource utilization within the hospital.
